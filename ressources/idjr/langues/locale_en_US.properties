  To start a game, customize it according to your preferences. Give the game a name to personalize it. Then, decide how many players will participate (between 3 and 5) and how many will be real participants or bots. Adjust the game speed to match your skill level: a slower speed to take your time, or a faster pace for dynamic games. If you want to add a strategic dimension, enable the "Spy Allowed" option.\n\n\
  In some cases, a screen will allow you to set the bots' level (Low, Medium, or Expert) and their names. Once these settings are completed, proceed to the connection screen to welcome players. When a player attempts to join the game, you can accept or decline their request. After accepting participants, assign their turn order to organize the game flow.
helpTextHelpScreenPPTI.page2=Player Placement and Colors\n\n\
  Once the game is configured, players can choose their positions and colors. Each player has a token initially positioned at the center of the screen. To settle in, simply drag the token to an area around the screen. Once placed, the player can select a color for their token to be easily identifiable throughout the game. This step ensures everyone has their place and helps avoid confusion.
helpTextHelpScreenPPTI.page3=Game Screen and End of Game\n\n\
  The game screen is the core of the experience. Each player has a dedicated area to view their remaining buoy cards, weather cards, the tide card they received, and their discard pile. Two tide cards are drawn and visible at the center of the screen.\n\n\
Game Rules Summary:\n\n\
1. Two tide cards are drawn face-up at the start of each round.\n\
2. Each player selects a weather card from their hand and places it face down on the table.\n\
3. Once all cards are placed, they are simultaneously revealed. The player with the highest weather card takes the lowest tide card, and so on.\n\
4. The tide cards taken are placed in front of the players, forming a stack. If a player already has a tide card, the new one is stacked on top of the old one.\n\
5. The player with the highest tide card loses one buoy. In case of a tie, the tied players each lose a buoy.\n\n\
When all rounds are complete, a summary screen displays the final rankings, scores, and remaining buoys for each player. You can then choose to replay with the same settings or return to the main menu.

  Before joining a game, customize your profile by entering your name and setting the total number of players in the game (between 3 and 5). Once these settings are done, the connection screen presents a list of available games. Each game displays information such as the number of connected players or whether bots and the "Spy" option are enabled. If you have specific preferences, use filters to find a game that matches your expectations. Simply select the game of your choice to join it.

  During the game, your tablet helps you track your progress. At the bottom of the screen, you?ll find your hand with all your weather cards. A sorting function is available to organize your cards easily. In the center, you can view essential information such as the number of remaining buoy cards, the tide card you received, and your current score. At the top of the screen, instructions guide you in your actions and strategic choices.\n\n\
  At the end of the game, a summary appears with your ranking, total score, and the number of buoys lost. This screen allows you to assess your performance and prepare strategies for the next game.
